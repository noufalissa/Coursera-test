Module1-solution :

The idea of this assignment is to create a front-end application that presents the user with a textbox where they can list comma-separated items, they usually eat for lunch. Once that's entered, the user has to click the "Check If Too Much" button. If the number of items in the textbox is less than or equal to 3 (e.g., 1, 2, or 3), a message should show up under to the textbox saying "Enjoy!". If the number of items is greater than 3 (4, 5, and above), the message "Too much!" should show up under the textbox. If the textbox is empty and the user clicks the "Check If Too Much" button, the message "Please enter data first" should show up. 'Empty' here means either "" (empty string) or a string with just spaces in it. Only 1 message should be shown at any given time.



Module2-solution :

The idea of this assignment is to create a "check off" shopping List application. Think of being in a store with a shopping list that allows you to "check off" the items you've already bought, except instead of checking them off, the bought item simply moves to the "Already Bought" list. HTML page is only displaying 2 lists, one titled "To Buy" and the other "Already Bought". The "To Buy" list is pre-populated with a list of at least 5 items. Next to each item in the list there is a button with the label "Bought". When the user clicks on the "Bought" button, its associated item is removed from the "To Buy" list and appear in the "Already Bought" list. The "Already Bought" list is initially empty and display a message "Nothing bought yet". Once the user "buys" every item on the "To Buy" list, i.e., clicks on the "Bought" button for every item in the "To Buy" list, instead of the empty "To Buy" list, the message "Everything is bought!" is displayed.
